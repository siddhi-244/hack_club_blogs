Hello myself Siddhi Satish Bhanushali, 
I am one of the hack club leads.You can connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/siddhi-bhanushali-4178591b2).Being selected as a lead, I was so excited to start something new.As soon as I got selected, I started making a good team. And after that we all started thinking about how to start. Soon we came up with an idea and we decided to conduct a hands on workshop on Machine Learning with python for beginners.
